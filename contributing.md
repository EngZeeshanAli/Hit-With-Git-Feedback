## Hit With Git | Google Developers Club

To contribute to the repository and add your feedback about the event:

1. Fork the repository to your profile
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine
3. In your cloned repo, you'll see a folder called "feedback" and inside that there will be a schema.json, like so:

```
{
  "github_id": "",
  "name": "",
  "institution": "",
  "dsc_chapter": "",
  "event_review": "",
  "answer1": "",
  "answer2": ""
}



```

4. Create your own .json file in feedback folder with your github ID and duplicate the contents of schema.json, like I have done with sinnytk.json(present in "feedback" folder)

```
{
  "github_id": "sinnytk",
  "name": "Tarun Kumar",
  "institution": "DHA Suffa University",
  "dsc_chapter": "DHA Suffa University",
  "event_review": "I loved it, I feel the power of open source in me",
  "answer1": "Answer for question1 here",
  "answer2": "Answer for question2 here"
}
```

5. Fill the values of fields in your personal [github_id].json with appropriate answers as done in sinnytk.json with answers for question1 and question2 in answer1 and answer2 respectively.:

```
Question 1: What is difference between forking and cloning?
Question 2: What is the difference between pull requests and simply using "git push"?
```

6. Push the changes in your forked repository
7. Make a pull request to this repository
8. Wait for the pull request to be approved and merged

## Voila!
